                      <p class="description mt-3">
                      We started off as data scientists and engineers at
                      companies like Amazon, Google, Adobe, Microsoft and
                      Zendrive.
                      Given the dynamic, experimentative and discovery-driven
                      nature of these projects, we found that the difficulty of
                      keeping track of and sharing progress within the team was
                      creating execution blind-spots. <br>
                      We tried several approaches: creating shared feature
                      libraries, standardizing
                      experimenting reporting templates, establishing coding
                      guidelines for reproducibility, etc. In the end, none scaled.
                      The project timelines became less predictable and
                      subsequent versions of
                      models involved repeated work. <br>
                      <span>With the rapid increase of ML across industries, we felt
                      this to be a compelling problem.</span>
